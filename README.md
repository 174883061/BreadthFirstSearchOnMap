To run this application, first of all you need to obtain and use your Google Maps API Javascript Developer Key.

Why do I need this key?
In this project you are developing an application that uses the Google Maps API.  Pretty cool, huh?  In order to do this, you need to get yourself a developer key.  Google allows you to develop apps that are used by small numbers of people for free, but they don't want you making the next viral app without paying them for their part in your product.  So Google uses your key to track how many calls are being made to their APIs.  They will contact you to ask for money if you make too many calls, but don't worry.  You're allow thousands of calls per day, so there's no way you'll hit this limit in this course!

Go to https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/ to get the key.

Open the file src/html/index.html and replace [APIKeyHere] with your own key.

Then you are good to go! Good luck!
